/**
  This class handles sending of invitations to attendees when Incidences (e.g.
  events or todos) are created/modified/deleted.

  There are two scenarios:
  o "we" are the organizer, where "we" means any of the identities or mail
    addresses known to Kontact/PIM. If there are attendees, we need to mail
    them all, even if one or more of them are also "us". Otherwise there
    would be no way to invite a resource or our boss, other identities we
    also manage.
  o "we: are not the organizer, which means we changed the completion status
    of a todo, or we changed our attendee status from, say, tentative to
    accepted. In both cases we only mail the organizer. All other changes
    bring us out of sync with the organizer, so we won't mail, if the user
    insists on applying them.

  NOTE: Currently only events and todos are support, meaning Incidence::type()
        should either return "Event" or "Todo"
